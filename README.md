# Outlier investor analysis

## Background

Speculative behavior in in the real estate market over the last 15 years has had major destructive effects on the city of Detroit. 

## Hypotheses

### Hidden investor theory

The city is owned very inequitably. Large landowners own most of the parcels in the city, but we're unable to see this from the data due to obscuring of ownership trail due to multiple LLCs, hired agents.

#### Why this makes sense

#### Questions

#### Problems

### Detroit parcel scam theory

When the mortgage crisis hit Detroit, the investment value of many parcels in the city went effectively to zero. This wasn't obvious to investors newly empowered with the capability to buy parcels online in the Wayne County Tax Auction. Parcels and homes were available for purchase by the thousands for 3 or 4 digit dollar amounts. 

This wasn't precedented in any housing market that real estate investors able to operate in the city would have known in their lifetimes. To them, it felt like an arbitrage opportunity. Buy low in the auction, or in bulk from those who did, and sell them In parts of the city, this was a valid strategy, but for most parcels these were bad investments.

These didn't turn out to be investments that it was particularly easy to make a return on. Investors then utilized (or intensified previous habits of) exploitative behaviors, scam land-contract deals, purchasing for nothing, not paying taxes etc. This still is not a great way to make money, so they reverted to wholesaler behavior.

#### Why this makes sense

There are too many parcels owned by entities who only own one parcel in the city of Detroit. There are too many to be easily explained away by our inability to connect owners together. Though this is definitely happening.

#### Questions to explore

1. How would a typical portfolio purchased at the Wayne County Tax Auction in 2012-2016 would have fared:
  - As 'fixed and flipped' homes?
  - As rentals?
  - As pass-along sales?
  - As land-contract scams?

Also, how does this compare to other potential available investments, like equity markets, other real estate markets, genuine real estate improvement investments, etc?

2. Is there activity of 'wholesaler' behavior for any investors?
  - It would be especially worth looking at the 'real estate guru' who was selling the ability to create an LLC and Detroit properties in the same workshop. What was the scale at which this was happening?

3. We're having trouble telling if the LLCs are actually the same. Is there a way that we can be more certain that they're different?

#### Problems

1. Too large of a potential buyer base to land on. In order for the 140k ish parcels to land on the books of independent investors (many of whom are city residents) doesn't seem very easy.
2. Too large of a system to distribute the parcels out. The business systems required to sell parcels at the scale needed to move over the time period are unlikely to be in place.
3. Detroit was maybe actually a good investment over that time frame?

### Global capital entered the market

The explanation for the odd distribution is that many of the smaller owners are actually large owners of real estate of which Detroit parcels make up only a small part of their holdings.

#### Problems

Plausible, but this is hard to identify from the assessors file, especially if the investors are using LLCs that are based locally.


I.
We know that some of these large landlords are bigger than we can tell from basic linking and de-duplication. 

How many other large-scale investors are we missing?

II.
We can look at the cumulative value held by investors ordered by size, and see what that distribution looks like.

Does this make sense, or look wrong? If you assume x number of investors gather up some distribution in number of smaller entities how does that cumulative picture change?

III.
What do the business models look like? Can we make some assumptions about how people make money with these schemes to figure out the size of portfolios that make sense? 

Do they have target holding sizes?

How much buying and selling happens?

IV.
We could look at side-lots and some ways people engage in small-scale ownership that isn't likely to be intended as professional investment.
